      "Extraction": "Introduction\nBullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune subepider-mal blistering disease. It typically presents in older adults as a general-ized pruritic bullous eruption and is often associated with significant morbidity. The clinical presentation is quite polymorphic, particularly during the early stages of the disease or in atypical variants, in which full-blown bullous lesions may be absent. In these cases, establish-ing the diagnosis of BP requires a high degree of suspicion. The anti-gens targeted by patients' autoantibodies represent two components of hemidesmosomes, the junctional adhesion complexes found in skin and adjacent mucosae (see Fig. 28.3A).",

A decade later, Jordon, Beutner, and colleagues² demonstrated that BP patients had tissue-bound and circulating auto-antibodies directed against the cutaneous basement membrane zone (BMZ), an observation that suggested that subepidermal dysadhesion was due to autoantibodies directed against structural components of the skin². Further milestones in our understanding of BP included the immunochemical characterization of targeted proteins, the cloning of their genes, and the development of animal models of the disease³⁻⁵.",

      "Extraction": "Epidemiology\nBP is typically a disease of older adults, with a mean age of presentation between 65 and 85 years. The annual incidence has been estimated to range from 5 to 45 new cases per million population per year. The incidence rate of BP appears to have significantly increased over the past two decades, most likely reflecting an aging population, better recogni-tion of atypical variants, and a rise in drug-induced BP⁶. A relative risk for patients over 90 years of age appears to be ~300-fold higher than for those 60 years of age or younger. The disease also occurs in children, but rarely. Certain HLA class II alleles are more prevalent in patients with BP than in the general population⁷. In Caucasians, a significant asso-ciation with the allele DQB1*0301 has been noted, while an increased frequency of the alleles DRB1*04, DRB1*1101, and DQB1*0302 has been observed in Japanese patients.",

      "Extraction": "Pathogenesis\nBP is an example of an immune-mediated disease that is associated with a humoral and cellular response directed against two well-charac-terized self-antigens: BP antigen 180 (BP180, also known as BPAG2 or type XVII collagen) and BP antigen 230 (BP230, also referred to as the epithelial isoform of BPAG1 [BPAG1e]) (Table 30.1)³,⁴. While the for-mer is a transmembrane protein with a large collagenous extracellular domain, the latter is a cytoplasmic protein belonging to the plakin fam-ily (see Ch. 28). These two antigens are components of the hemides-mosomes, which are adhesion complexes promoting epithelial-stromal adhesion in stratified and other complex epithelia.\nIn vitro studies and in vivo animal models have demonstrated the pathogenic role of autoantibodies in BP. Furthermore, in gestational pemphigoid, a disease closely related to BP, the transplacental transfer of anti-BP180 autoantibodies from the mother to the neonate can result in a transient bullous eruption (see Ch. 34).",

      "Extraction": "Humoral and cellular responses\nAlmost all patients with BP have circulating IgG autoantibodies that bind to BP180. Specifically, it is the non-collagenous NC16A domain, a region of BP180 located extracellularly but close to the transmem-brane domain, that constitutes the immunodominant region (see Fig. 31.9)⁸,⁹. However, additional antigenic sites exist within both the extracellular and intracellular domains of BP180, and they are recog-nized by up to 70% of BP sera⁸,⁹. Patients with BP also exhibit signifi-cant autoreactivity to BP230, and BP230-reactive autoantibodies bind predominantly to the COOH-terminal region of this autoantigen⁴,⁸,⁹. The presence of several antigenic sites throughout BP180 and BP230 most likely results from the phenomenon known as \"epitope spread-ing\" (see below). This phenomenon may also account for the finding that patients' sera rarely contain autoantibodies targeting additional components of the BMZ.\nPatients with BP develop an autoreactive T cell response to BP180 and BP230. Likely related to a dysfunction of regulatory T cells, it is crucial for stimulating B cells to produce autoantibodies¹⁰,¹¹. The responsiveness of anti-BP180 autoreactive T cells is restricted by cer-tain HLA class II alleles (e.g. HLA-DQB1*0301), which are prevalent in BP patients. These T lymphocytes, whose major relevant epitopes seem to be harbored within the NC16 domain, have a CD4+ phenotype and produce both Th1 (e.g. interferon-γ) and Th2 cytokines (e.g. interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-13; see Ch. 4)¹⁰,¹¹. Th2 and Th17 cytokines, which are particularly relevant to the pathophysiology of BP, predominate within lesional tissue and in patients' sera¹⁰⁻¹³.\nUpon binding of autoantibodies to their target antigens, subepider-mal blister formation results from a cascade of events in which Fc",

Within intertriginous zones, vegetating plaques may be observed (pemphigoid vegetans; see Fig. 30.6C).

These disorders are usually distinguished on the basis of the clinical history and setting, pathologic features, and the negative findings with IF microscopy. The presence of bullae raises the possibility of bullous arthropod bites and the eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy, allergic contact dermatitis, bullous drug eruptions (see Ch. 33), dyshidrotic eczema, pseudoporphyria, or porphyria cutanea tarda. In children, bullous impe- tigo, inherited epidermolysis bullosa, and bullous mastocytosis must also be considered. The pemphigus group, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and derma- titis herpetiformis can be differentiated on the basis of distinctive immunopathologic findings and clinical context. In patients with a subepidermal blistering disorder associated with linear deposits of IgG or C3 along the BMZ, the presence of the following clinical criteria point to the diagnosis of BP: (1) absence of skin atrophy; (2) absence of mucosal involvement; (3) absence of head and neck involvement; and (4) age greater than 70 years 18,20,22. Nevertheless, the distinction of BP from the following disorders can sometimes prove challenging (see Table 30.1). • Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations (see below). While the classic “non- inflammatory” form of EBA is sufficiently distinctive, the “inflammatory” form closely mimics BP. As in BP, mucosal involvement may be present 18,20. • Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) represents a group of subepidermal blistering diseases rather than a single entity (see Ch. 31). While features of LABD are polymorphic in adults, during childhood the condition is frequently associated with annular and polycyclic lesions, often with peripheral blisters, as well as involvement of the genital and perioral region. However, identical features are also observed in childhood BP (see Fig. 30.7B)18,20. • Anti-p200 pemphigoid (anti-laminin y1 pemphigoid). Although patients often have features similar to BP, they tend to be younger and are more likely to have involvement of palmoplantar and cephalic regions as well as the oral mucosa.

Skin lesions occur in up to 30% of patients and favor the head and upper trunk. When there is both mucosal and cutaneous involvement, distinction from BP may be difficult, but a predominance of mucosal lesions with a scarring tendency and limited skin involvement point to MMP. • Chronic pruritic dermatoses of the elderly and early-stage BP. In the elderly, pruritus, alone or in combination with nonspecific skin lesions, is a common complaint. There are myriad underlying causes and a thorough assessment is often required (see Ch. 6). A dilemma arises when patients with pruritus have circulating autoantibodies to the epidermal BMZ and reactivity with BP180 and/or BP230, but routine DIF microscopy remains negative 18,35.

Furthermore, determination of anti-BP180 IgG antibody levels by ELISA at days 0, 60, and 150 appeared to help predict disease relapse a small (<20%) decrease in serum autoantibody levels between days 0 and 60 was associated with relapse during the first year of therapy35. Finally, a high BP180-NC16A ELISA score (>27U/ml) and, to a lesser degree, positive DIF findings at cessation of therapy are both good indicators of future relapse of BP. As noted previously, the extent and degree of disease activity can be assessed by employing the BP disease area index (BPDAI)21 or a daily blister count. Treatment The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the disease and comorbidities (Tables 30.3 and 30.4)22,37-47. For extensive disease, often defined as > 10 new blisters/day or inflammatory lesions involving large areas or multiple body sites, either systemic or widespread ultra- potent corticosteroids are employed. Oral prednisone (0.5-0.75mg/kg/ day; 1 mg/kg may result in significant side effects and increased mortal- ity) usually controls the disease within 1-2 weeks. If there are no new lesions or pruritus for at least 2 weeks 22,39, then the dosage is progres- sively tapered to a low dose over a period of 4-6 months, or occasionally longer. Low-dose prednisone is then continued for an additional 3-6 months 22. Rarely, pulse therapy with methylprednisolone is required for rapid control of the disease. In controlled trials, ultrapotent topical cor- ticosteroids, e.g. clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream, had the same effi- cacy as oral corticosteroids, with fewer systemic side effects and reduced mortality 22,41. Two topical regimens have been described: standard and mild, in which the starting doses are clobetasol 40 g/day and clobetasol 10-30 g/day, respectively (see Table 30.3)41. While ultrapotent topical corticosteroids can be tried first, cost, compliance, and ease of applica- tion in the elderly may be limiting factors. Immunosuppressive therapies can serve as steroid-sparing agents and are employed when corticosteroids alone fail to control the disease, there are contraindications to the use of systemic corticosteroids, and/ or comorbidities exist that limit the dosage of corticosteroid (e.g. diabe- tes mellitus, osteoporosis, psychosis) 22. The most frequently employed agents are azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (1.5-3 g/day), metho- trexate (7.5-15 mg/week), and cyclophosphamide (see Table 30.4). The dosage of azathioprine (0.5-2.5 mg/kg/day) should be adjusted according to the level of thiopurine methyltransferase, in order to increase efficacy and reduce myelosuppression (see Ch. 130). In the elderly, the dose of methotrexate requires careful monitoring as renal function is often",

The disorder should not be regarded as a clinical entity, but rather as a “disease phenotype” shared by a heterogeneous group of blistering diseases, with predilection for the mucosal surfaces48. The majority of patients have linear deposits of immunoglobulins and/or complement components along the epithelial BMZ of the skin and mucosae. Circulating anti-BMZ autoantibodies are detected in the serum of some patients (20%-30% by standard IIF), usually at a low titer or concentration. It is a chronic and progressive disease, which may result in serious mucosal complications. When postinflammatory atrophy or scarring affect the conjunctivae, the disorder can be devastat- ing and ultimately lead to blindness. History In 1794, Wichmann first described a chronic blistering disease associ- ated with involvement of the eyes. Civatte separated this disorder from pemphigus on the basis of peculiar histopathologic findings in 1949, and Lever later suggested the name “benign mucous membrane pemphi- goid”, a misnomer in view of the potentially severe complications of the disorder. During the latter part of the 20th century, the term “cicatricial pemphigoid” was used primarily. In 2012, based upon an international consensus conference, the term “mucous membrane pemphigoid” was proposed. Demonstration of immunoreactants deposited along the epithelial BMZ by IF microscopy pointed to an autoimmune origin. Epidemiology The annual incidence of MMP is ~1 to 2 cases per million popula- tion49, with a calculated prevalence (in Germany) of 25 cases per million inhabitants. MMP typically occurs in the elderly, with a mean age at the time of diagnosis of between 60 and 80 years. However, isolated cases have been reported in children. Women are affected more frequently than men (estimated ratio 1.5-2:1). Although no geographic or racial predilection has been described, several studies have shown an associa- tion with specific immunogenetic HLA class II haplotypes, e.g. HLA- DQw7 (subtype HLA-DQB1*03:01), in both oral and ocular forms of the disease 50. There is no overall association with malignancy, but in a distinct subtype associated with IgG autoantibodies directed against laminin 332 (also known as anti-epiligrin cicatricial pemphigoid), an increased relative risk for cancer has been suggested 48,51. Although this is debated, a search of an associated solid tumor may be recommended in case of anti-laminin 332 reactivity. 48 For example, in a retrospective study of 154 patients, an association of anti-laminin 332 reactivity with malignant neoplasms was noted, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2350a. Recently, MMP has been observed in patients receiving immune check- point inhibitors.",

      "Extraction": "Pathogenesis Mucocutaneous lesions are thought to result from the binding of auto- antibodies to the BMZ of stratified epithelia of mucosae and skin. These autoantibodies recognize distinct structural components of the hemides- mosomal adhesion complex. Specifically, they appear to bind predomi- nantly to antigenic sites located extracellularly within the anchoring filament zone rather than within the hemidesmosomal plaque 52. However, the pathogenicity of various IgG autoantibodies associated with this disease phenotype (see Table 30.1) has not yet been established unequivocally and other mechanisms may also be involved. In a minor- ity of patients with MMP, BP180-NC16A domain-specific T cells are detectable. Increased expression of collagen-binding heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) and TGF-β1 by conjunctival fibroblasts may contribute to the conjunctival scarring seen in patients with ocular disease53. Based upon their autoantibody profile, patients with MMP can be divided into four distinct subgroups. The first subgroup includes those with autoantibodies directed against laminin 332. This subgroup was previously referred to as anti-laminin 332 MMP or anti-epiligrin cicatri- cial pemphigoid54. It is estimated that 18%-30% of patients with MMP belong to this subgroup 55. Patients with anti-laminin 332 IgG autoanti- bodies frequently have multiple sites of mucosal involvement, including the pharynx, larynx, and trachea48. Their circulating IgG autoantibod- ies bind to the dermal side of salt-split skin and react with the α3 chain (G domain) and, less frequently, the β3 and/or γ2 chain of laminin 332 (α3β3γ2) (see Fig. 28.5). Occasionally, antibody binding to the α3 chain of laminin 311 (previously termed laminin 6 [a heterotrimer of α3β1γ1 chains]) is also observed because of the presence of cross-reacting auto- antibodies. In vitro and in vivo studies have provided convincing evi- dence that autoantibodies to laminin 332 are pathogenic 55. In the second group of patients, involvement is exclusively or pre- dominantly ocular. IgG autoantibodies that bind to the ẞ4 subunit of α6β4 integrin, a transmembrane hemidesmosomal component that interacts with laminin 332, have been described anecdotally. Some cli- nicians refer to this subset as ocular MMP (see Fig. 28.3A)56. A third subgroup of patients, who lack a specific clinical phenotype, have tissue-bound and circulating IgG antibodies that react with the same target antigens as in BP, especially BP180. These patients, who have been classified as having anti-BP antigen MMP, represent the largest subgroup. The antigenic regions targeted on BP180 are located within the NC16A domain and on its distal COOH-terminal portion. The latter appears to extend into the lamina densa region of the BMZ (see Fig. 28.3A) 52. There is ample scientific evidence that anti-BP180 IgG antibodies are pathogenic11. The fourth group is rather heterogeneous. It includes patients who have variable involvement of the mucosae without involvement of the skin. While it is yet unclear whether injury occurs as a result of an autoantibody-mediated immune response against proteins of the BMZ, a few patients with an MMP phenotype have shown reactivity against type VII collagen. It has been reported that a small subset of patients with oral MMP have autoantibodies which bind to the α6 subunit of α6β4 integrin, but this needs to be validated 57. Clinical Features Mucous membranes The two most frequently involved sites in patients with the “mucous membrane pemphigoid phenotype” are the oral and conjunctival muco- sae. However, the disease may also start in, and affect, any mucosal site, including the nasopharyngeal, anogenital, laryngeal, or esophageal mucosa (in descending order of frequency) 48,58-60. Approximately 90% of patients have oral involvement (often in the absence of skin lesions), and the oral cavity may be the only site of disease activity in up to 30% of patients. Lesions frequently involve the gingiva, buccal mucosa, and palate; the alveolar ridges, tongue, and lips are less commonly affected. A classic oral presentation is desquama- tive gingivitis accompanied by bleeding erosions and paresthesias (Fig. 30.14A); small intact blisters are rarely observed. Chronic inflamma- tion may lead to periodontal ligament damage and the loss of teeth. In other areas of the mouth, transient vesicles give rise to chronic erosions, especially on the palate (Fig. 30.14B), with variable associated pain. Lesions on the tongue are usually localized to its lateral and ventral surfaces. Adhesions may develop in the area of the uvula and tonsillar fossae as well as between the tongue and the floor of the mouth. White, reticulated striations that resemble oral lichen planus may also be seen. Conjunctival involvement occurs in ~40% of patients 48,54 and can result in blindness60. The conjunctivae are frequently the only site affected. Although the disease may begin unilaterally, in the majority of patients, lesions appear in both eyes. Ocular involvement starts as a nonspecific chronic conjunctivitis and limbitis, with burning, sore- ness, foreign-body sensation, decreased vision, and/or mucus produc- tion. Periods of exacerbations and subsequent remissions are typical, with eventual progression to a scarring due to subepithelial conjunctival fibrosis (Fig. 30.15). Conjunctival vesicles or blisters are rare on the tarsal conjunctiva. Chronic inflammation may result in progressive scar tissue formation, leading to a shortened inferior fornix and symblepharon (an adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctival surfaces; Fig. 30.16) as well as ankyloblepharon. Conjunctival fibrosis can also result in trichiasis (inwardly angled eyelashes) and entropion60. In uncontrolled disease, trichiasis, entropion, and xerosis (due to scarring of the lacrimal ducts) eventuate in superficial corneal trauma, corneal neovascularization with subsequent corneal ulceration, and blindness48. Nasopharyngeal involvement occurs in a third of patients with MMP and is typically chronic and asymptomatic 48,59. It results in crusted intranasal ulcerations, epistaxis, fibrous adhesions between adjacent mucosal surfaces, and airway obstruction. Pharyngeal involvement presents as ulcerations of the posterior or lateral pharynx and dys- phagia. Laryngeal involvement is a potentially serious manifestation, presenting as hoarseness, loss of speech, and even life-threatening ste- nosis, which requires tracheostomy. Although esophageal disease may be accompanied by dysphagia resulting from erosions of the esophageal mucosa, involvement can be",

However, the pathogenicity of various IgG autoantibodies associated with this disease phenotype (see Table 30.1) has not yet been established unequivocally and other mechanisms may also be involved. In a minority of patients with MMP, BP180-NC16A domain-specific T cells are detectable. Increased expression of collagen-binding heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) and TGF-β1 by conjunctival fibroblasts may contribute to the conjunctival scarring seen in patients with ocular disease⁵³. Based upon their autoantibody profile, patients with MMP can be divided into four distinct subgroups. The first subgroup includes those with autoantibodies directed against laminin 332. This subgroup was previously referred to as anti-laminin 332 MMP or anti-epiligrin cicatricial pemphigoid⁵⁴. It is estimated that 18%-30% of patients with MMP belong to this subgroup⁵⁵. Patients with anti-laminin 332 IgG autoantibodies frequently have multiple sites of mucosal involvement, including the pharynx, larynx, and trachea⁴⁸. Their circulating IgG autoantibodies bind to the dermal side of salt-split skin and react with the α3 chain (G domain) and, less frequently, the β3 and/or γ2 chain of laminin 332 (α3β3γ2) (see Fig. 28.5). Occasionally, antibody binding to the α3 chain of laminin 311 (previously termed laminin 6 [a heterotrimer of α3β1γ1 chains]) is also observed because of the presence of cross-reacting auto-antibodies. In vitro and in vivo studies have provided convincing evidence that autoantibodies to laminin 332 are pathogenic⁵⁵. In the second group of patients, involvement is exclusively or predominantly ocular. IgG autoantibodies that bind to the β4 subunit of α₆β₄ integrin, a transmembrane hemidesmosomal component that interacts with laminin 332, have been described anecdotally. Some clinicians refer to this subset as ocular MMP (see Fig. 28.3A)⁵⁶. A third subgroup of patients, who lack a specific clinical phenotype, have tissue-bound and circulating IgG antibodies that react with the same target antigens as in BP, especially BP180. These patients, who have been classified as having anti-BP antigen MMP, represent the largest subgroup. The antigenic regions targeted on BP180 are located within the NC16A domain and on its distal COOH-terminal portion. The latter appears to extend into the lamina densa region of the BMZ (see Fig. 28.3A)⁵². There is ample scientific evidence that anti-BP180 IgG antibodies are pathogenic¹¹. The fourth group is rather heterogeneous. It includes patients who have variable involvement of the mucosae without involvement of the skin. While it is yet unclear whether injury occurs as a result of an autoantibody-mediated immune response against proteins of the BMZ, a few patients with an MMP phenotype have shown reactivity against type VII collagen. It has been reported that a small subset of patients with oral MMP have autoantibodies which bind to the α6 subunit of α6β4 integrin, but this needs to be validated⁵⁷. Clinical Features Mucous membranes The two most frequently involved sites in patients with the \"mucous membrane pemphigoid phenotype\" are the oral and conjunctival mucosae. However, the disease may also start in, and affect, any mucosal site, including the nasopharyngeal, anogenital, laryngeal, or esophageal mucosa (in descending order of frequency)⁴⁸,⁵⁸⁻⁶⁰. Approximately 90% of patients have oral involvement (often in the absence of skin lesions), and the oral cavity may be the only site of disease activity in up to 30% of patients. Lesions frequently involve the gingiva, buccal mucosa, and palate; the alveolar ridges, tongue, and lips are less commonly affected. A classic oral presentation is desquamative gingivitis accompanied by bleeding erosions and paresthesias (Fig. 30.14A); small intact blisters are rarely observed. Chronic inflammation may lead to periodontal ligament damage and the loss of teeth. In other areas of the mouth, transient vesicles give rise to chronic erosions, especially on the palate (Fig. 30.14B), with variable associated pain. Lesions on the tongue are usually localized to its lateral and ventral surfaces. Adhesions may develop in the area of the uvula and tonsillar fossae as well as between the tongue and the floor of the mouth. White, reticulated striations that resemble oral lichen planus may also be seen. Conjunctival involvement occurs in ~40% of patients⁴⁸,⁵⁴ and can result in blindness⁶⁰. The conjunctivae are frequently the only site affected. Although the disease may begin unilaterally, in the majority of patients, lesions appear in both eyes. Ocular involvement starts as a nonspecific chronic conjunctivitis and limbitis, with burning, soreness, foreign-body sensation, decreased vision, and/or mucus production. Periods of exacerbations and subsequent remissions are typical, with eventual progression to a scarring due to subepithelial conjunctival fibrosis (Fig. 30.15). Conjunctival vesicles or blisters are rare on the tarsal conjunctiva. Chronic inflammation may result in progressive scar tissue formation, leading to a shortened inferior fornix and symblepharon (an adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctival surfaces; Fig. 30.16) as well as ankyloblepharon. Conjunctival fibrosis can also result in trichiasis (inwardly angled eyelashes) and entropion⁶⁰. In uncontrolled disease, trichiasis, entropion, and xerosis (due to scarring of the lacrimal ducts) eventuate in superficial corneal trauma, corneal neovascularization with subsequent corneal ulceration, and blindness⁴⁸. Nasopharyngeal involvement occurs in a third of patients with MMP and is typically chronic and asymptomatic⁴⁸,⁵⁹. It results in crusted intranasal ulcerations, epistaxis, fibrous adhesions between adjacent mucosal surfaces, and airway obstruction. Pharyngeal involvement presents as ulcerations of the posterior or lateral pharynx and dysphagia. Laryngeal involvement is a potentially serious manifestation, presenting as hoarseness, loss of speech, and even life-threatening stenosis, which requires tracheostomy. Although esophageal disease may be accompanied by dysphagia resulting from erosions of the esophageal mucosa, involvement can be",

Patients may present with either a non-inflammatory vari-ant, the features of which strikingly resemble those observed in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), or with an inflammatory variant that mimics BP. Infrequently, the clinical phenotype resembles MMP, the Brunsting-Perry variant of MMP, or LABD.\nHistory\nThe first cases of an acquired bullous disease with clinical features mimicking hereditary dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa were described by Elliot in 1895. In the early 1970s, before the advent of cutaneous immunopathology, Roenigk and colleagues proposed the initial clinical criteria for EBA. A few years later, IF microscopy studies demonstrated that EBA patients have anti-BMZ antibodies, similar to BP patients. In the early 1980s, immunoelectron microscopy studies separated EBA from BP by demonstrating that IgG deposits in EBA were located in the sublamina densa region of the BMZ. In the 1990s it was shown that EBA autoantibodies bind to type VII collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils75.\nEpidemiology\nEBA has been reported in both children and adults and may occur at any age. It is one of the rarest subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases in Western Europe, with an estimated annual incidence of ~0.25 per million people49,77. It may be more common in specific Asian popula-tions (e.g. Koreans) as well as in African-Americans.\nPathogenesis\nThe pathogenic role of autoantibodies to type VII collagen is sup-ported by several lines of evidence76. Patients with EBA have tissue-bound and circulating IgG autoantibodies against type VII collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils (see Fig. 28.3A). In addition, titers of anti-type VII collagen antibodies parallel disease activity in EBA patients, and neonates of mothers with EBA can develop tran-sient blisters due to diaplacental transfer of anti-type VII collagen IgG autoatibodies74,77.\nType VII collagen is located within the lamina densa and sublamina densa region of the BMZ (see Fig. 28.2). It is composed of three identi-cal α-chains, each of which consists of a central 145kDa collagenous triple helical segment, flanked by a large 145 kDa non-collagenous NH2-terminal domain (NC1) and a short 30kDa COOH-terminal region (NC2). Patients' autoantibodies target immunodominant epitopes within the NC1 domain of the protein. However, reactivity with either the cen-tral collagenous domain or the NC2 domain is also observed, albeit rarely. It is, as yet, unclear if binding activity to certain antigenic regions of the molecule correlates with a distinct clinical phenotype (see below).\nIn vitro, EBA autoantibodies, together with the complement system and neutrophil elastase and gelatinase B, are able to mediate leukocyte infiltration (via FcγRIV expression) and dermal-epidermal separation.

It is likely that the expression of distinct HLA alleles has a critical impact on the susceptibility to developing EBA. The observation that deficient expression of type VII collagen in patients with various forms of dystro-phic EB causes skin fragility and dermal-epidermal separation demon-strates unequivocally the importance of this protein in maintaining the integrity of the epidermal BMZ77.",

Clinical Features EBA usually occurs in adult patients, although pediatric cases have been reported. Cutaneous manifestations are heterogeneous and may mimic other bullous diseases⁷⁷,⁷⁸. The classic presentation is that of a non-inflammatory mechanobullous disease characterized by the development of acral blisters that heal with atrophic scarring, milia formation, and dyspigmentation⁷⁷. Cutaneous blisters, which may become hemorrhagic, and evolving erosions appear within non-inflamed skin or on areas of scarring. They are localized to trauma-prone surfaces, especially the elbows, knees, and dorsal aspects of the hands, occiput, back, feet, and toes (Fig. 30.18). As in inherited dystrophic EB, acral involvement in EBA may be mutilating, leading to a \"mitten\" deformity of the digits, webbing between adjacent fingers or toes (pseudosyndactyly), nail dystrophy, and complete",

The BP-like presentation is the most common inflammatory form of EBA77-79. It is characterized by widely distributed, pruritic vesicles and bullae on an erythematous base.

Lesions heal without milia or atrophic scars (Fig. 30.19).\nOther inflammatory subtypes of EBA are quite uncommon77-79 and include those whose presentation resembles MMP, the Brunsting-Perry variant of MMP with scarring alopecia, and LABD with a polymorphous bullous eruption and a linear band of IgA deposits along the BMZ. Of note, during the course of the disease, the clinical features can convert from one variant to another or, alternatively, a mixture of inflammatory and non-inflammatory features may coexist.\nMucous membrane involvement occurs not only in MMP-like EBA, but is also observed in up to 50% of patients with the mechanobullous and BP-like presentations77-79.

In the BP-like or MMP-like variants of EBA, there is a variable inflammatory infiltrate within the dermis, composed predominantly of neutrophils admixed with eosinophils and lymphocytes. In the mecha-nobullous non-inflammatory lesions, there is a minimal-to-absent cel-lular infiltrate.\nElectron microscopy studies of fresh vesicles demonstrate that der-mal-epidermal cleavage occurs within the sublamina densa zone. In addition, a reduction in the number of anchoring fibrils may be observed. However, in some cases, separation within the lamina lucida has been noted, most likely reflecting the formation of a subepidermal blister at the locus minoris resistentiae. The level of cleavage is, there-fore, not always a reliable criterion for discriminating EBA from other subepidermal bullous disorders.\nDirect immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy\nDIF microscopy studies of perilesional skin demonstrate IgG deposits distributed in a continuous, rather broad, linear pattern along the epider-mal BMZ. Less commonly, linear deposits of C3, IgA, or IgM are found. In salt-split skin preparations of perilesional skin, the immune deposits are typically located on the dermal side of the cleavage.

      "Extraction": "at the BMZ. Finally, the FOAM technique (see above), employing a confocal laser scanning microscope, localizes the immunoreactants to the level of the BMZ where type VII collagen is expressed⁷⁷. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) microscopy By standard IIF, circulating anti-BMZ antibodies can be detected in ~50% of patients with EBA. They are primarily of the IgG class, but serum IgA autoantibodies have also been reported. By IIF on salt-split skin, circulating IgG or IgA antibodies bind to the dermal side of the artificial blister³⁰,⁷⁷,⁷⁹,⁸¹. Although not often available, testing of patients' sera either against a panel of skin substrate specimens lacking distinct basement membrane molecules (e.g. BP180, type VII collagen, laminin 332) or against HEK cells transfected with the recombinant NC1 domain of type VII collagen can prove helpful in characterizing the antigens targeted by circulating autoantibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy Immunoelectron microscopy has traditionally been considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing EBA, especially when circulating autoantibodies are absent and therefore cannot be characterized by IIF microscopy, immunoblot, or ELISA (see below)⁷⁷. By immunogold techniques, which allow a more precise localization than peroxidase labeling, EBA autoantibodies specifically bind to the anchoring fibrils and the lamina densa where anchoring fibrils originate and terminate (see Fig. 28.3A). Other immunochemical studies, including ELISA In Western immunoblot analyses of dermal extracts, serum autoantibodies from patients with EBA were found to bind to proteins of ~290kDa and, less frequently, 145kDa. These proteins have been clearly shown to correspond to type VII collagen and its NH₂-terminal NC1 subdomain, respectively⁷⁷,⁸¹. Epitope mapping studies using recombinant forms of type VII collagen have demonstrated that immunodominant epitopes are located within the NC1 domain⁸¹. ELISAs are now available, utilizing either the recombinant NC1 domain of type VII collagen or a combination of recombinant NC1 and NC2 domains⁸²,⁸³; these assays exhibit high specificity (>96%) and are likely more sensitive than IIF microscopy studies utilizing salt-split skin⁸³. Serum concentrations of collagen VII-specific IgG autoantibodies, as determined by ELISA, may correlate with disease severity⁷⁷. Differential diagnosis EBA may be confused with inherited dystrophic EB, BP, MMP, LABD, porphyria cutanea tarda, pseudoporphyria, or rare variants of porphyria (e.g. porphyria variegata). Clinically, the mechanobullous type of EBA most closely resembles mild dominant dystrophic EB, but the lack of a family history, late onset, and the positive DIF findings generally allow for distinction. However, some patients with inherited EB do develop autoantibodies against type VII collagen. The involvement of the hands may mimic porphyria cutanea tarda, but the latter can easily be excluded by porphyrin studies. Occasionally, patients with EBA on incriminating medications are misdiagnosed as having pseudoporphyria. The inflammatory type of EBA is clinically indistinguishable from BP, anti-p200 (anti-laminin γ1) pemphigoid, or MMP, including the Brunsting-Perry variant. These conditions may be distinguished by u-serrated versus n-serrated DIF pattern analysis, FOAM technique, ELISA, IIF with salt-split skin as a substrate, Western immunoblot analysis of both epidermal and dermal extracts, and direct immunoelectron microscopy studies⁷⁷,⁸⁴. Bullous systemic LE usually presents as a transient, widespread, inflammatory subepidermal blistering condition (see Ch. 41), and, less frequently, as a mechanobullous eruption with milia formation and scarring⁷⁵,⁷⁷. In a number of these cases, circulating autoantibodies show binding to type VII collagen and the possibility of systemic LE-associated EBA could be considered. In addition to differences in histology, adult EBA exhibits a poor response to treatment, while a significant improvement following initiation of dapsone or azathioprine therapy is generally seen in patients with bullous systemic LE⁸⁵. Treatment Treatment of EBA is difficult and often unsatisfactory. Because of the rarity of the condition, most data on treatment are based on anecdotal reports⁶⁷,⁷⁴,⁷⁷. Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide or, more recently, rituximab, are sometimes helpful in controlling the BP-like variant of EBA, which may eventually go into clinical remission. Colchicine, dapsone, and cyclosporine have also been reported to have some benefit. In patients with severe EBA unresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive therapy, IVIg ± rituximab may prove effective⁷⁷,⁸⁵. A combination of dapsone plus prednisolone has been recommended by some authors for the treatment of childhood EBA⁷⁴.
